 <br><br><br>Simply the number of elements in the vector. Order is important, but no dimension is more important than another,<br><br>Dimensionality of a vector is number of coordinate axes the vector exists.<br>
For example 2D vector is in 2D space.<br>Major departure from typical Cartesian axis:<br>
<br>Coordinates do not need to be orthogonal (ex. x and y dimensions are orthogonal from one another)
<br>Can have non-orthogonal axis.
<br><br>Field - A set of numbers for which basic arithmetic operations are defined.<br>
<br> - Real Numbers 
<br> - Complex Numbers
<br> - Rational Numbers
<br>For example  stands for all real 2-dimensional numbers.<br><br>Vector Space - Any set of objects for which addition and scalar multiplication are defined.<br>Required Properties (addition and scalar multiplication):<br>
<br>Additive Inverse: 
<br>Associativity: 
<br>Commutativity: 
<br>Additive Identity: 
<br>Multiplicative Identity: 
<br>Distributivity: 
<br><br><br>Subspace - is the set of all points you can reach by stretching and combining a collection of vectors (i.e. by addition and scalar multiplication)<br>With one 2-D vector, we can create a infinitely long line.<br>
With two 2-D vectors, we can potentially reach many points -- to which we can span a plane.<br><br>Distinction between subspace and ambient space: subspace is embedded.<br>
For example, a subspace of 2D can be embedded in a 3D ambient space.<br>Dimensionalities vs. Subspaces
How many subspaces are possible in a ambient space?<br>
Infinitely Many<br>
How many subspace dimensionalities are possible with a N-dim ambient space?<br>
Finite Number: N+1
<br>For example, for , there are  subspace dimensionalities. .<br><br>Subspace - is the set of all points that satisfies:

<br>Closed under addition and scalar multiplication
<br>Contains zeros vector 0





<br>1D subspace embedded in a a 3D ambient space

<br><br>Subset - Region in space that can have boundaries instead of extending to infinity

<br>Set of all points on XY plane s.t.  and 
<br>Set of all points s.t.  and 
<br>Set of all points s.t.  (this is also a subspace)

<br><br><br>Similar to subspace, but span is the region of ambient space that can be reached by any linear combination of a set of vectors.<br>
Can be thought of as:<br>
<br>Subspace is a noun
<br>Span is a verb<br>
A set of vectors span, and the result is a subspace.
<br><br>Span is set of all points that can be obtained by any linear weighted combination of those vectors

 <br>Scalars - Single numbers -- constants.<br><br><br>Vector is a line -- [1 2], a line with slope 2.<br><br><br><br>Convention to assume vectors are in column orientation, unless stated otherwise!<br><br><br><br>Should be trivial.<br><br>Also known as the inner product or scalar product.<br>
Important because it provides information about the relationship between two vectors.<br>
Is applied in:<br>
<br>Convolution
<br>Correlation
<br>Fourier Transform
<br>Matrix Multiplication
<br>Signal Filtering
<br><br><br>Example: <br><br>Taking the dot product on vector itself:<br><br><br><br>Scalar:                       (c is a constant)<br>
However, this does not apply with dot products:<br>
Row vs. Column Vector Output: <br><br><br><br>Interesting Example:<br>
<br><br><br><br><br> = Angle between two vectors<br>
Can rewrite the equation:<br>

<br><br>Sign is determined exclusively by angle (the magnitudes are lengths and thus always positive)
1 Cosine of acute angle is always positive<br>
2 Cosine of obtuse angle is always negative<br>
3 Cosine of right angle is 0, vectors are orthogonal<br>
4 Cosine of 0 is 1. The lines are collinear (or the same line).<br>
5 Same as 4, but with negative sign. Still referred to as collinear<br>

<br><br>Equivalence
 
<br>Proof
Check page 53 of Cohen, to prove:<br>

<br><br>

<br>
<br>All vectors have the same dimensionality
<br> can be any real number including 0.
<br><br>Way of combining two vectors to produce a matrix.
 and  are column vectors.<br>

<br><br>Each element  in the outer product matrix is the scalar multiplication between  element in first vector and  element in second.<br> <br><br><br>Each column in the outer product matrix comes from repeating the left vector but scaled by each element in the row vector<br><br>Form outer product matrix one row at a time, by repeating row vector M times (for M elements of vector w).<br><br>Multiply corresponding elements in the two vectors. Requires same number of elements.<br>
<br><br>Only defined for 3-element vectors, and results in another 3-element vector.<br>Geometry based formula, used to create a vector c which is orthogonal to the plane spanned by vectors  and . <br><br>Vector with length of one: <br>
